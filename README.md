Hi There, 😉   

I has been very amazing jorney while predciting probability of IPL matches by using to data from 2008-2022 competition. 📊 📊 📊 
Here, I have developed the machine learning Algorithm which can help to get predictions while the IPL match is in progress. In that, I have used some feature engineering, Data Preprocessing, Feature engineering, and Imputation techniques as well as implemented domain knowledge in order to get some new extra features. ⚡ ⚡ ⚡ ⚡ ⚡ 
Understand feature importance and accordingly select the algorithm which can give me good progression results while the match is live.
First I had to go for RandormForest but I was given a very straightforward prediction so I decided to move on with the logistics regression which help to get the best progression result.
In this algorithm, I have taken 2nd inning data where we need to provide the batter team situation and accordingly predict whether the batting team will win or not.
I used technology like pandas,NumPy,plotly,scikit-learn,streamlit,pycharm,anaconda environement in order to prediction and local deployment.

🏏 🏏 🏏 🏏 
I am super excited to work more projects please let me know if you have better idea. 😊
